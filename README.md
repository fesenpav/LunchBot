# LunchBot

## About

A simple "runnable" Discord bot, that scrapes lunch menu websites and delivers the menus in the specified format to a Discord server.

The purpose of this project is to practice around with C#, slightly practice Dependency Injection - but mainly for fun and so that I know, what to eat today!

## TO-DO List

- [ ] Remove hard-coded translations
- [ ] Remove hard-coded web-pages
- [ ] Add additional pages to scrape
- [ ] Add environment variables for Docker
